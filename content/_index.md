Random articles I ([mmmray](https://github.com/mmmray)) wrote.

The site is available in two forms: As a bunch of [Markdown files on GitHub](https://github.com/mmmray/wall-documents), and [as a real website](https://mmmray.github.io/).

All articles are licensed as

translation I am happy to link or host it here.
